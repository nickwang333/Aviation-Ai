# Aviation Safety & Crash Analysis AI

## Overview

A domain-specific AI designed to help aviation professionals, journalists, and researchers analyze past plane crashes, identify patterns, and suggest safety improvements.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection (Knowledge Base)

The AI sources and processes data from:

- Official accident reports from NTSB (U.S.), FAA, ICAO, BEA, etc.
- Aviation safety databases (ASN, FAA incident reports)
- Boeing & Airbus safety documents
- Pilot & air traffic control transcripts (CVR data)
- Weather reports & maintenance logs
- Research papers on aviation safety

### 2. Data Processing & Indexing

- Converts accident reports, PDFs, and text into searchable vector embeddings.
- Stores data in a vector database (FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate).
- Enables metadata filtering (e.g., year, airline, aircraft type, cause of crash).

### 3. AI Search & Analysis (RAG Pipeline)

Users can ask questions such as:

- _"What were the main causes of Boeing 737 crashes in the last 10 years?"_
- _"How did pilot error contribute to the Air France 447 crash?"_
- _"What safety measures were implemented after the Tenerife disaster?"_

The AI retrieves relevant accident reports and generates a summary explaining causes, contributing factors, and outcomes.

### 4. Output & Visualization

- AI-generated plain-language summaries.
- Charts/graphs of accident trends.
- Timeline of aviation safety improvements after major crashes.
- Risk assessment of different aircraft models.

## Potential Use Cases

- **Aviation students:** Learn from past crashes in a structured way.
- **Pilots & airlines:** Understand common accident causes and preventive measures.
- **Investigators & journalists:** Quickly access relevant reports on aviation incidents.
- **Safety analysts:** Identify trends and make data-driven safety recommendations.

## Tech Stack

- **LLM (AI Model):** GPT-4, LLaMA, Mistral (for summarization)
- **Data Storage:** PostgreSQL (structured data), FAISS/Pinecone (vector search)
- **Retrieval Engine:** LangChain or LlamaIndex (RAG framework)
- **Frontend:** Next.js or Streamlit (for interactive search)
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI or Flask) or Node.js
- **Cloud Services:** AWS S3 (for document storage), OpenAI API (for AI processing)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/aviation-safety-ai.git
   cd aviation-safety-ai
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python backend
   npm install  # If using a Next.js frontend
   ```
3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file and configure API keys for OpenAI, vector database, and cloud storage.
4. **Run the Application:**
   ```sh
   python app.py  # If using FastAPI/Flask
   npm run dev  # If using Next.js for frontend
   ```
